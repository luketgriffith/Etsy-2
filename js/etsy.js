We ship from Las Vegas, so it can sometimes take 7 business days for packages to reach the East Coast via First Class Mail. Priority Mail packages are usually delivered within three days of shipping, but the USPS does not guarantee delivery by a certain date for Priority or First Class packages, so sadly neither can we. \r\n\r\nWe are happy to ship Priority Mail for an extra charge. Shipping upgrades are available to the time of check out, when using a web browser to access Etsy. Shipping upgrade options are not currently available via the Etsy mobile app.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS: \r\n\r\nWe do ship internationally; however, we cannot promise your package will arrive by a certain date. Sometimes packages are held up in Customs for seemingly no reason, and transit times vary wildly. For example, we have had packages reach the UK anywhere from 10 days to 24 days after sending.\r\n\r\nWe ship overseas via First Class Mail International, which is the only cost-effective option (and as you can see, even that is quite expensive). This method doesn&#39;t provide reliable tracking information.\r\n\r\nWe are not responsible for any additional customs tariffs or charges that your country imposes on your package, nor can we predict what they might be. \r\n\r\nFor more information about customs fees, please read the Etsy FAQ: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/help\/article\/5023","policy_refunds":"We are always happy to exchange or replace your item free of charge if it is damaged in transport, or if we made a mistake in sending the wrong item.\r\n\r\nIf your item is lost in the mail or damaged by the USPS, we will send a replacement free of charge using the original shipping method. \r\n\r\nIf the postal service claims your item was delivered, but you didn&#39;t receive it, we will send a replacement, but we ask that you cover the cost of re-shipping.","policy_additional":"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\r\n\r\nI CAN&#39;T FIND THE EMPATHY CARDS IN YOUR ETSY SHOP.\r\nOur Etsy shop is a curated, limited selection of our products.

I will send you the tracking number after your package has shipped.\n\nAll of my masks are cut and molded by hand from leather, carefully painted with acrylics, and sealed with matte leather sealer and a gloss varnish for protection. The back of the mask is signed and dated. You have the option of either a satin ribbon or elastic cord, which can fastened behind the ears and under the hairline for a secure fit. If you need to take your mask on and off repeatedly while wearing, I recommend the elastic cord. If you are going to be wearing your mask for a long period of time or would like to hang it on a wall, go with the satin ribbon.\n\nThis mask is from my new series called &quot;Mini Masquerade&quot;, in which I&#39;ve produced a set of more compact, stylized animals that are well suited for use as halloween costumes, masquerade masks, and as fun photo props at weddings.\n\n-----------------------------------\nIf you are interested in a custom order for an item that I am not currently displaying in my store, send me a message and I can give you a quote. I&#39;ve enjoyed working with many customers doing custom pieces.\n\nIf you are interested in multiple masks, ask me about the discount.\nIf you need shipping to a country that is not listed, message me.","creation_tsz":1444150244,"ending_tsz":1454781044,"original_creation_tsz":1400179969,"last_modified_tsz":1444150244,"price":"80.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":10,"tags":["meerkat mask","african mask","meerkat","leather mask","masquerade mask","unique costume","halloween mask","photo booth","mask prop","meerkat manor","meerkat costume","animal costume","child costume"],"category_path":["Accessories"],"category_path_ids":[69150467],"materials":["leather","acrylic paint","satin ribbon","elastic cord"],"shop_section_id":12352353,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1442323379,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/189714222\/meerkat-leather-mask-adult-or-child?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":200,"num_favorers":12,"shipping_template_id":663197995,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":"halloween","style":["African","Fantasy"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":12,"taxonomy_path":["Accessories","Costume Accessories","Masks & Prosthetics"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":602850951,"hex_code":"69593C","red":105,"green":89,"blue":60,"hue":39,"saturation":42,"brightness":41,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1400179969,"listing_id":189714222,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/6040193\/il_75x75.602850951_fezz.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/6040193\/il_170x135.602850951_fezz.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/6040193\/il_570xN.602850951_fezz.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/6040193\/il_fullxfull.602850951_fezz.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":602850911,"hex_code":"75644B","red":117,"green":100,"blue":75,"hue":36,"saturation":35,"brightness":45,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1400179969,"listing_id":189714222,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/6040193\/il_75x75.602850911_q9wp.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/6040193\/il_170x135.602850911_q9wp.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/6040193\/il_570xN.602850911_q9wp.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/6040193\/il_fullxfull.602850911_q9wp.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":602850769,"hex_code":"776958","red":119,"green":105,"blue":88,"hue":33,"saturation":26,"brightness":46,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1400179969,"listing_id":189714222,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/029\/0\/6040193\/il_75x75.602850769_mfyq.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/029\/0\/6040193\/il_170x135.602850769_mfyq.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/029\/0\/6040193\/il_570xN.602850769_mfyq.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/029\/0\/6040193\/il_fullxfull.602850769_mfyq.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":602850855,"hex_code":"736C66","red":115,"green":108,"blue":102,"hue":28,"saturation":11,"brightness":45,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1400179969,"listing_id":189714222,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/032\/0\/6040193\/il_75x75.602850855_skg1.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/032\/0\/6040193\/il_170x135.602850855_skg1.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/032\/0\/6040193\/il_570xN.602850855_skg1.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/032\/0\/6040193\/il_fullxfull.602850855_skg1.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":602744772,"hex_code":"716B60","red":113,"green":107,"blue":96,"hue":39,"saturation":15,"brightness":44,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1400179969,"listing_id":189714222,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/031\/0\/6040193\/il_75x75.602744772_nban.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/031\/0\/6040193\/il_170x135.602744772_nban.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/031\/0\/6040193\/il_570xN.602744772_nban.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/031\/0\/6040193\/il_fullxfull.602744772_nban.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":6040193,"shop_name":"LovelyLiddy","user_id":11218450,"creation_tsz":1286041095,"title":"LovelyLiddy","announcement":"Welcome to my leather mask shop!
